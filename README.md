Realtime-Port-Authority
=======================

The purpose of this was to create a real-time tracking of port authority
of Pittsburgh, PA, using the realtime API given by [Port Authority](http://realtime.portauthority.org/bustime/home.jsp).

Right now, the plan is to make an app for both Android using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)
and on Windows Mobile. Hopefully make a wobsite for this too lel.
