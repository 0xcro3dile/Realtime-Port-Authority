Realtime-Port-Authority
=======================

The purpose of this was to create a real-time tracking of port authority
of Pittsburgh, PA, using the realtime API given by [Port Authority](http://realtime.portauthority.org/bustime/home.jsp).

Right now, the plan is to make an app for both Android using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)
and on Windows Mobile.
A website is also in the works.

API limitations:
- the buses don't update until after 10+ seconds. Our app only updates 
every 10 seconds
- There are only a couple buses offered publicly. We promise to get updates
to the new buses as soon as possible!

######Current Realtime Port Authority Routes:
- 41 (Bower Hill)
- 48 (Arlington)
- 56 (Lincoln Place)
- 8  (Perrysville)
- 86 (Liberty)
- 88 (Penn)
- P1 (East Busway - all stops)
- P3 (East Busway - Oakland)
- Y49 (Prospect Flyer)

#Android Development

This will be done using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) 0.8.6 beta as of 08-20-2014.
