black-bus-stop.svg is the bus stop svg that I got from [here](http://www.clker.com/clipart-map-symbols-bus-stop-black.html). Thank you Karen Morgan for making this free!

I used Inkscape in Ubuntu to move it to use the bus stops in many 
different pngs (requirement in Google Maps).

Take note that this is in the res/drawable-*dpi folders as bus_stop.png 
for the different screen sizes and retrieved in requestline.
